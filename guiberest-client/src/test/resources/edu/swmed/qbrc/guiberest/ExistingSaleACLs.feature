Feature: Existing Sale ACLS

    In order to verify that ACL validation is working properly, we're following the example
    scripted at https://github.com/jonyoder/ACL-Brainstorming/blob/master/Example.md to create,
    read, update, and delete sale information as various users.
    
    Here, we're testing while attempting to retrieve and modify existing sales that were
    imported in import.sql 

    Background:
        Given I'm ready to go
    
    Scenario: Verify that we can correctly retrieve an existing sale.

        Then I see the following full sale results:
            | 23 | 36 | 12 |   14.66 |
    
    Scenario: Retrieve an existing Sale as a User with a Sale ACL but No READ Permission to the Sale's Store

    Scenario: Move an existing Sale to a different Store without a READ ACL for the New Store
