Feature: Create New Sale ACLS

    In order to verify that ACL validation is working properly, we're following the example
    scripted at https://github.com/jonyoder/ACL-Brainstorming/blob/master/Example.md to create,
    read, update, and delete sale information as various users. 

    Here, we're testing while attempting to insert, modify, and delete new sales that were
    not included in our import.sql.

    Background:
        Given I'm ready to go
    
    Scenario: Insert Sales, retrieve as owner, and Check ACLs
        When I insert the following sale data as user thomas:

        When I request sale data for the following ids as user thomas:
            | 50 |
        Then I see the following sale results:
            | 50 | 12 | 21 |   38.92 |
        And I request ACL data for the 50 id and the sale class as user thomas
        Then I see the following ACL results:
            | <any> | thomas-test | NULL | read     | edu.swmed.qbrc.guiberest.shared.domain.guiberest.Sale | 50 |
            | <any> | NULL        |    5 | read     | edu.swmed.qbrc.guiberest.shared.domain.guiberest.Sale | 50 |
