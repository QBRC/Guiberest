Feature: Create New Sale ACLS

    In order to verify that ACL validation is working properly, we're following the example
    scripted at https://github.com/jonyoder/ACL-Brainstorming/blob/master/Example.md to create,
    read, update, and delete sale information as various users. 

    Here, we're testing while attempting to insert, modify, and delete new sales that were
    not included in our import.sql.

        Then I see the following full sale results:
            | 21 | 50 | 12 |   38.92 |
