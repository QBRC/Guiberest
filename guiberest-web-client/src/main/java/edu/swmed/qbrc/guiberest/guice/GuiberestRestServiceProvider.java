		 *   Here, we create a thread-safe ClientConnectionManager, provide it to a default
		 *   HttpClient, and pass the HttpClient to a custom GWTClientExecutor.
		 *   
		 *   If you need the thread-safe ClientConnectionManager, but not the custom
		 *   GWTClientExecutor, then replace the ClientExecutor line with the following:
		 *   
		 *      ClientExecutor executor = new ApacheHttpClient4Executor(httpClient);
		 *      
		 * NOTES:
		 *   
		 *   The RESTEasy library's default ClientExecutor, which is used by the Client Interceptor,
		 *   was not working with GWT apps.  I think that GWT must append form parameters to all
		 *   requests automatically.  When the ClientExecutor code sees the form parameters, it
		 *   assumes that it's dealing with a POST request, and attempts to cast the request to
		 *   an HttpPost request, which fails since it's actually a GET request.  I created a
		 *   custom ClientExecutor that extends the implementation used by RESTEasy, and configured
		 *   it to simply assume that we're dealing with a GET request.  I added the extended
		 *   ClientExecutor to the CasHmac client library. It's up to the developer using the library
		 *   whether to go with the custom ClientExecutor or the default one provided by RESTEasy.
		 *   
		 *   Because the default client connection manager used by RESTEasy is not thread safe, and
		 *   since some applications may fire off several REST requests simultaneously, I started
		 *   having issues with secondary REST requests failing due to a previous connection that
		 *   was still open. After reading some of the JBoss documentation, I figured out how to set
		 *   up a thread-safe client connection manager, which takes care of the problem.
